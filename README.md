# Edge-Detetion-In-Blured-Image
Hi....this is a simple program which sharpen and clean the given blurry image.

Here Deep Learning is used. Basically here we are having a lot train, test data and with the help of GAN model we will predict the cleared image. Inside the GAN we are having two other model known as Generative and Discriminatory.

A generative model focuses on explaining how the data was generated, while a discriminative model focuses on predicting the labels of the data.
